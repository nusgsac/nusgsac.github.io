Looking for a job or internship? Worried about what to do after getting your Masters or PhD degree?
In this article, we go over some useful tips on getting an internship and/or job for SoC graduate students by asking some popular questions to the Centre for Future-ready Graduates, represented by Dr. May Koh. 

<br />

### Q1. Can you introduce yourself and tell us what the Centre for Future-ready Graduates does?
 
Hello, I am May Koh, the assigned career advisor for SoC postgraduates from the Centre for Future-ready Graduates (CFG in short).
 
CFG provides various career advisory sessions and workshops throughout the academic year. In these sessions, we’ll discuss career plans, resume critiques, mock interviews and personal branding to prepare students strategically to land their “dream role” upon graduation. Students can reach out to us on any career related matters through these sessions. We also invite speakers from various industries to talk about strategies targeted for specific career pathways. 
 
Having been an academic researcher myself for over 10 years while serving as a mentor during my postdoctoral period, I, along with my colleagues at CFG, am always looking for innovative ways to better things for SoC graduate students.
 
<br />

### Q2. With recent challenges from the COVID-19 crisis, how do you view the job market for our graduate students at SoC? 
 
Despite the COVID-19, growth of the digital economy has definitely accelerated the hiring in the digital related job roles. But such accelerated hiring comes along with new skill sets required in both tech and non-tech industries. With the focus on advanced manufacturing and innovation, there is a race for non-routine connective jobs as well. Especially, Singapore is Asia's leading city for development with our digital infrastructures and pool of talents. The digital landscape will spread across the government corporation’s institution as well as in the start-ups.
 
<br />

### Q3. Sounds like exciting news for SoC students! What are some tech companies / industries that offer jobs for our SoC graduate students? And what kind of opportunities do they offer?

Here you can see tech companies categorized by a range of digital capabilities. These are the world's top tech companies that are currently based in Singapore. On top of that, as you may already know from the news, big organizations like Alibaba, ByteDance, Twitter, and Zoom are now establishing their presence in Singapore.  These are the types of companies that will offer job opportunities to SoC graduates.

Based on statistics taken from graduates, a majority of our masters and PhD students end up in IT / ICT industries. Other industries such as Finance and Insurance are pivoting to digitalization (e.g., Fintech, Healthtech, etc.) and hence keen on offering jobs to SoC graduate students.

<br />

### Q4. We notice that attending an industrial internship during postgraduate study has become popular. How do you view this trend? Does CFG provide any help in finding such internships for our students? 

Taking up an industrial internship is a great way for students to decide if a particular career is a good match to them. During the internship, students can also start to build a professional network that can be a valuable resource during the job search. It is worthy to mention that virtual internships are also becoming more common during this pandemic. 

At SoC, the current practice for Masters is that internships are taken up during the Special Term or vacation period, generally more uptake during Special Term (May, June, July period) as compared to the December vacation period. Masters students are allowed to take leave of absence for one semester.
 
As for PhD students, there is no fixed timeline, but they are encouraged to go on internships with top research labs for a period up to 6 months. Though this is not compulsory, PhD students are encouraged to go on internships where they will continue to be supported by the School with a paid leave of absence during their internship period. Internships for these PhD students should be aligned to one’s research direction and is usually up to the discretion of the individual PhD supervisors for approval.  
 
Currently, there is no compulsory requirement for SoC postgraduates (both Masters and PhDs) to take internships. But there will be some new requirements for students on MComp General Track and MSBA. 
 
For students on the MComp General Track, a new program that started in Jan 2021, there is an industry capstone which is a compulsory component, and has been designed into the curriculum of this new Master’s program. Students will have to intern for at least 4 months full-time with a local company in Singapore. 

<br />

### Q5. Are there any resources provided by CFG for our students to look for an internship? 
 
Yes, the default channel is NUS TalentConnect job portal for Masters. For PhD candidates, it is usually through the PhD supervisor, self-sourced by the students and very rarely offered via NUS TalentConnect.

<br />

### Q6. We have many international students among Masters or PhD students at SoC. What do these international students be aware of when applying for paid jobs? 
 
These are [recommended guidelines on CFG’s website](https://nus.edu.sg/cfg/students/jobs-internships/internships/vacation-internship-programme) for students who are interested in taking paid internships.
 
Generally, students holding an ICA issued Student Pass (STP) may consider the following options. 
 
For paid full-time internships, students are advised to take them during the two term breaks with respect to the NUS academic calendar. This is only applicable to Masters by Coursework students. Masters by Research and PhD students technically do not have vacation and thus can only do part-time with a maximum of 16 hours per week.  
 
Students can also choose a paid part-time internship for a maximum of 16 hours during the NUS term.  

<br />

### Q7. For those who already graduated, how can they look for help in finding full-time jobs or internships? 
 
There are two ways. First one is via the school’s website. They can log onto the _NUS TalentConnect_ job portal or keep a look out for weekly emails on the latest job opportunities. Besides _TalentConnect_, full-time enrolled students can also look for part-time work opportunities within NUS via the _NUS Student Work Scheme_ (NSWS) that aims to encourage NUS students to be self-reliant and to gain working experience on campus. For any administrative queries, they should check with the school admin.

On the CFG side, I would like to highlight the career support services. For career advisory, you can also choose to come as a group with your peers if you prefer. And there are regular workshops and advisory sessions as I mentioned earlier.

<br />
 
### Q8. Do we have any career fair specifically targeting SoC graduate students? If so, how many career fairs are there per year? 
 
Yes, we do! There are some major upcoming career fairs. There is so-called Internship Day on the _13th of October_ for those who are seeking internship opportunities. The postgraduate career fair this year will be held on _27th of October_, which will be focusing on jobs targeted towards postgraduates, and then there will be this **Career Fest 2022** which will be held in _January 2022_. 
 
Each career fair will have a series of pre-fair webinars and events to make sure students keep a lookout on this. In fact, we have hosted more than 600 events a year from emerging companies, multinational corporations, homegrown heroes as well as the public sector. The numbers are higher than usual due to COVID-19, and the events are virtual. If you are seeking job opportunities in any of these companies and industries, join these events to learn more about how to prepare yourself and make useful networks. Check out our CFG events calendar for the upcoming events  
 
<br />

### Q9. Can you elaborate more on what our students can expect from the career talks in this upcoming year (AY 2021/2022)? 
 
The postgraduate career advisory team will be organizing a series of workshops throughout the year. There will be Career Development Workshops, Industry Awareness Talks, PG Career Booster Workshops and recruitment events organized throughout the academic year. 
 
Students can start attending this career development workshops and industry awareness workshop as early as your first semester, to get started on their resume and LinkedIn profile, as well as to start thinking about the industry that they may wish to enter. From the second semester, students can start attending career booster workshops to hone their soft skills and join recruitment events to find out the technical skills and soft skills required to perform the role that they may be interested in. This will give students the time to work on any gaps. 
 
Below are the confirmed dates for the upcoming workshops for this semester. Seats are limited, so please look out for the emails from myself for the registration links!

These are the two upcoming confirmed dates for the postgraduate industry awareness workshops. This is the career booster series that are open to the wider and NUS population, including undergraduates and postgraduates for you to learn about advanced interview techniques and workplace skills. The workshops will cover three main themes: advanced interview and assessment skills, industry insiders and workplace success skills.
 
For the rest we are in the process of confirming the dates with the other speakers so do keep a lookout for more information and registration links in your emails. 
 
<br />

### Q10. Lastly, do you have any final words of advice to our postgraduate students?
 
A postgraduate journey, especially a PhD, can sound very daunting at first.  
And it is reassuring to be aware that students can always reach out to CFG for support not only in job search, but also in understanding _values_, _interests_, _personalities_, and _skills_, so as to brand their unique selling points (aka USPs) strategically for personal branding.  
 
When at an interview, having a personal branding would translate to: **_“Why must it only be you and not the other candidates that came before or after you?”_** Understanding who you are and what you want is important before you begin your job search because this means that you will be happier in your future role when your values are aligned.  
 
Keep an open mind with your options open and be updated on the emerging industry trends. That means if you are a student from STEM, it does not mean that you need to end up doing a STEM role. At CFG, we organise regular talks with industry partners who provide insights into the industry, specific job roles, and the organization’s work culture. This is one of the many avenues to tap into if you want to stay in the known for potential opportunities on the latest employment landscape.   
 
In addition to reaching out for a career advisory session with me, students may also wish to explore the _NUS Career+_ App that can help them plan their education, build their skills profile, and develop their career pathway. After establishing your USPs, start networking early to build your social capital since relationships need to be nurtured and you will be able to harvest the “fruits” when you are ready to embark on your job search journey at the end of your studies. “_conNectUS_” is a new professional networking platform that helps the NUS community to connect with other students and AlumNUS to share ideas, and acquire insights and opportunities. 
 
Lastly, stay connected with us by visiting and bookmarking the [CFG webpage](https://nus.edu.sg/cfg/) and keep a look out for upcoming career-related events on our events calendar and weekly emails for job alerts. 
I am sure that your ‘future’ self will be thanking your ‘now’ self for taking this important step in preparing yourself today for your future career.  
 
In the words of William Shakespeare, “We know what we are now, but not what we may become.” So be excited as you embark on this adventure of career exploration journey because the career of your dreams may just lie ahead. Thank you, GSAC team, for organising this Q&A session. I hope to e-meet SoC graduate students soon in upcoming career advisory sessions!
 
Thank you, Dr Koh, for your time!  

We look forward to having these exciting events you mentioned!
