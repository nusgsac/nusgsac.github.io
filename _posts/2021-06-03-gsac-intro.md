<!-- Intro -->
Pursuing a graduate degree at NUS School of Computing (SoC) can be stressful and lonely. With a clear intention to improve the life of graduate students at SoC by creating a venue for social interaction and collaboration, a group of students--with support of Professors Prateek Saxena and Kuldeep Meel--started an initiative called Graduate Student Association in Computing (aka GSAC) early in 2021. 

In this short blog post, we describe what this student-led initiative is about, what we have done and want to do in the future, and how any interested graduate student or faculty can get involved.

<!-- <br /> -->

According to the [NUS student directory](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/student-records/student-statistics), there were over 900 graduate students--around 350 of which being PhD students--enrolled at SoC during the 2020-2021 academic year. And yet, there has been a lack of opportunities where these students can interact and get to know each other. What we want to achieve through GSAC is very straightforward. We want to create a venue to bring SoC graduate students and faculties together for socializing, networking, and research collaboration.

<!-- what we’ve done and will do --> 
Since a group of PhD students formed a team in February, 2021, we first spent our budget on distributing pizzas among students in celebration of our first Virtual Game Night.

Since February, we’ve had two Virtual Game Nights, playing a combination of an ice-breaker game, Skribbl, Among Us, and Re-Volt. Feedback from the attendees has been quite encouraging.

Due to restrictions posed by Covid-19 policies, however, we haven’t been able to hold any physical events. Regardless, we will continue to organize virtual events of this kind in the foreseeable future.

We have been brainstorming several ideas to increase our online presence. For example, we have launched a website (where you are reading this post from) and are planning to publish blog posts covering a range of interesting topics relevant to SoC students and faculties. In addition, we have been in touch with [NUS Centre for Future-ready Graduates](https://nus.edu.sg/cfg/), discussing possible collaborative events and workshops.

<!-- Concluding remark -->

We are still in the early stages to establish GSAC. We are open to new ideas and/or students who want to be part of the [team](/team.html) or simply want to write blog posts. If you don’t want to miss our events, don’t forget to subscribe to [#GSAC channel](https://nus-soc.slack.com/archives/C01KJM9S98X) on Slack.
